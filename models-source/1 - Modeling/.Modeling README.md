# Modeling Guide

In the **Modeling** stage, we want to create the base mesh of our model. *Quality here is important!* No matter how good your texturing, rigging, or animating, if your base mesh sucks, it'll look bad in Unity.

Models are generally catagorized into two types:

1. Hard Surface Models
2. Organic Models

Hard surface models are non-deforming models. Pretty much all non-living objects fall under the hard surface catagory. When modeling these, make use of the bevel modifier + harden normals, auto-smoothing/smooth by angle, and subdivision surface to achieve good results.

Organic models are deforming models. Most living objects (people, animals) fall under this catagory. Here, you'll have to use subdivision surface, shade smooth, and sculpting to achieve a good look. If your model is going to be animated, you'll also have to consider mesh deform quality when building out the pose of your model.

## Starting Your Model / Incoming Files

(Replace `ModelName` with your model's actual name.)

1. Ensure that your Blender version is `4.2.2 LTS` 
2. Ensure that you have installed all required plugins located in `astoria\blender-plugins\Required`. Read `Required Plugins README.md` for more details.
3. (optional) If you are modeling off a **Blockout**, move your blockout models to a separate collection. Name the collection `Blockouts`. Suffix each object in the collection with `_Blockout`. You can use Ctrl+F2 for this.
4. If you haven't already, create a folder named `ModelNameResources` under `astoria\models-source\Resources`. This is the model's resources folder.
5. If using references (either objects or images), move them to the model's resources folder.
6. Import your references into Blender. Make sure your references are linked instead of embedded.

## Procedure

Our goal is to create the polished, final mesh/meshes of your object. There may be some adjustments/optimizations needed for UV unwrapping in the **Texturing** stage, however.

1. 
Create the inital version first, then make a
copy, and reduce the tricount as much as possible. Ideally, keep the reduced tricount lower than 10,000.
At the end, you should have a finished model contained under one object. 

## Tips

For hard surface modeling (non organic objects), make use of auto smoothing. The bevel modifier with
Harden Normals checked looks good at low segment counts. Make sure your bevels never go above 1-2 segments.
You can combine separate meshes into one objects. It's perfectly fine to clip those meshes into each other.
Subdivision is the only way you can get good results for organic modeling (think curved, flowy surfaces).
It's also the only way compatible with sculpting.

## Next Steps

Once you're ready to make the final model, review the QA Check. 
Make sure your model meets it, then continue. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR TEXTURING.
Commit to the repo with "Done with modeling for [model name]"
Make a copy of your blend file to the texturing folder.
Commit to the repo with "Starting texturing for [model name]"
Don't delete the modeling file. You might need it later. 
Refer to Incoming in the Texturing README for what to do with the texturing copy.

## QA Check

Is your model made up of multiple objects? If so, combine them into one object/mesh.
Are your objects AND meshes named after the part of the model they represent?
Is the tri count reasonable? Make sure the reduced version is no more than 10,000 triangles, unless
ABOSLUTELY NEEDED. Aim for 1000-5000.
Are most faces quads/tris? N-gons are okay, as long as they're completely flat or in hidden places.
Are there any shading errors that immediately show when using MatCap view?
Is scale applied? Make sure all scale readouts in object mode show 1, 1, 1.
Is rotation applied? Unless it's needed for the model, make sure rotations show 0, 0, 0.
If your model is one object, make sure to move it to the world origin with:
Shift+S -> Cursor To World Origin -> Click on your model -> Shift+S -> Selection To Cursor.
If this doesn't completely move it to the world origin, center it manually and apply position.
